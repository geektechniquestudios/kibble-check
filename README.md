## Simplifying Your Dog's Meal Schedule

Welcome to KibbleCheck, a unique Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to streamline your dog's meal schedule. Our mission is to eliminate the guesswork and stress from your pet's feeding routine, ensuring your dog is fed consistently and on time, every time. Say goodbye to overfeeding and missed meals!

## Features

### Intuitive User Interface

Our custom calendar rolodex component is designed with simplicity in mind. Scroll to any day and check a box for AM and PM meals. Each checked checkbox signifies a meal that's been served, providing you with peace of mind and a consistent feeding routine for your pet.

### Collaborative Feeding (Coming Soon)

We're working on a feature that will allow multiple users to access and update your dog's meal calendar. Whether it's a spouse, dog walker, neighbor, or a family member, anyone assisting with feeding duties can easily mark when they've fed your furry friend. This eliminates the need for guesswork or waking up your partner to ask if the dog was fed.

## Technology Stack

KibbleCheck is built with a robust and modern technology stack:

- Yarn
- React
- Firebase
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

This combination of technologies allows us to create a sleek, intuitive, and responsive application.
